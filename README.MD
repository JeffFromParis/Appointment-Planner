# Appointment Planner
*A Project by Jeff Vergne*

This project is part of the **Fullstack Engineer Career** path from **CodeCademy**.
It is a practice project from the **React Part 2** module. 

## Objective
In this project, I will use functional React components to create an app that manages contacts and appointments. The app consists of two pages: one to view and add contacts and one to view and add appointments.

I will work with stateful and stateless functional React components using hooks.

## Technology
Developped with React.
